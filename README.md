For this assignment, I wanted to play with animating data in a way that was evocative of the data itself. In particular, I chose a dataset of earthquakes that have occured in the past hour and focused predominantly on the magnitude of said earthquakes. 

The visualization itself is meant to be evocative of the rolling shockwaves of an earthquake, with the size and speed varying based on the magnitude of the quake (more powerful earthquakes being presented as bigger and slower, so their place on the screen is more readable and more prominant, and less powerful earthquakes being presented as smaller and faster). While the 'rolling' feel isn't quite there, I still like the way you can feel the scale of each earthquake in comparision to one another.
